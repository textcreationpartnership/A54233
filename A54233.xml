            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny <hi>Dayes</hi> and <hi>Weeks,</hi> yea, some <hi>Moneths</hi> hath my <hi>Heart</hi> been <hi>Heavy,</hi> and my <hi>Soul unusually Sad</hi> for the sake of this <hi>Nation,</hi> the <hi>Land</hi> of our <hi>Nativity!</hi> For I have not only long beheld with a grieved Eye the many <hi>Abominations</hi> and gross <hi>Impieties</hi> that reign therein, the <hi>Lusts, Pleasures, Wantonness, Drunkenness, Whoredoms, Oaths, Blasphemies, Envy, Treachery</hi> and <hi>Persecution of the Just,</hi> but for some time I have had a deep Sense, that the <hi>Overflowing Scourge</hi> of God's <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Indignation</hi> was just ready to break out upon the People, <hi>Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Amazement</hi> and <hi>Misery!</hi> The Weight of which hath causeal me to Cry within my self, <hi>Who shall Save us! Who shall Deliver us! Is there none to stay the</hi> Stroke, <hi>to blunt the</hi> Edge, <hi>to stop the</hi> Fury, <hi>and intercede for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60236:2"/>People, and mediate for this poor Land, that the Lord may not utterly depart, and take his Glory and his Name from it, and make it a Desolation for the</hi> Wild Beasts <hi>of the Field and Fowls of the Air, a Land of Judgment and not of Promise; of Curses, and not of Blessings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Friends,</hi> whilst the Sense of this <hi>Distress,</hi> that is coming as a <hi>Dreadful Visitation</hi> from the Hand of the <hi>Displeased</hi> God upon this <hi>Ungodly Land</hi> to <hi>Stain its Glory, Bring down its Pride</hi> and <hi>Punish its Forgetfulness of the Lord and his many Delivenantes,</hi> lay so Heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit, the Lord presented before me all the Truly <hi>Conscientious</hi> and <hi>Well-inclined</hi> people in these Nations; and more especially <hi>You,</hi> his <hi>Despised</hi> but <hi>Chosen Generation,</hi> for whose sake he would yet have Mercy. And in the midst of his <hi>Judgments, This</hi> I received for you from the <hi>Lord,</hi> as his Holy <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Counsel,</hi> and it often sprung in my Heart with a very Fresh and Strong Life;

And my witness is, that ye are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, through whom this <hi>Heavenly Seed</hi> of <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> must Clearly and Stedfastly so shine unto others in these <hi>Uneven</hi> and <hi>Rough Times,</hi> that are Come and Coming, as that your <hi>Heavenly Father may be glorified</hi> by you.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> be ye all <hi>Dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred of the World</hi> and <hi>Discharged</hi> of the <hi>Cares</hi> of it; Fly as for your Lives from the <hi>Snares</hi> therein, and get you into your <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> the NAME of the LORD! Which is not a <hi>Dead Name,</hi> or a meer <hi>Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Name;</hi> but a <hi>Living Spiritual</hi> and very <hi>Powerful Name:</hi> A <hi>Strong Tower</hi> indeed, yea, an <hi>Invincible Fortress;</hi> where, dwell ye with God, and in him who speaketh <hi>Peace</hi> to his Children, and ordains <hi>Quietness</hi> for them that trust in him. He will make you to lie down <hi>Safely,</hi> even then when <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> shall be thick about you; yea, ye shall live in the <hi>Fire,</hi> that will <hi>Consume the Stubble of the World,</hi> and your <hi>Garments</hi> shall not be so much as <hi>Singed: for the Son of God, whom the Flames, as well as Winds and Seas obey, will be in the Midst of you.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60236:3"/>I beseech you, that is the Enemy's Work to weaken you within; but be ye <hi>Retired,</hi> be ye Centered in the <hi>Eternal One,</hi> and Meditate upon the Lord and his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Pure Law,</hi> that ye may be <hi>Wise in Heart</hi> and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in Spirit for this <hi>Poor Land,</hi> and that for Enemies as well as Friends. The <hi>Lord</hi> is ready to hear you for this people, when ye are ready to <hi>Intercede;</hi> and I testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, <hi>Abraham</hi> is amongst you, <hi>God's Friend,</hi> and his <hi>Just Lot</hi> too; yea, <hi>Jacob,</hi> that <hi>Prevailed:</hi> &amp; <hi>One,</hi> that is Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then them all, JESUS, the <hi>Lamb</hi> of <hi>God, whose Blood speaketh better things, than that of</hi> Abel, in whom is the <hi>Mediation</hi> and <hi>Attonement.</hi> Be therefore encouraged to wait upon the Lord, and to bow before him, and humbly to <hi>Meditate</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> of JESUS with him: I know, he will put it into your Hearts so to do, if ye wait upon him. For he will not cast off this Land, as he did <hi>Sodom;</hi> he hath a <hi>Right Seed,</hi> a <hi>Noble People</hi> in it, that he hath and yet will gather: many Sheep there be not yet of our Fold, whom he will bring in, and the foul Weather and the <hi>Storms</hi> will but help to drive them Home to JESUS, the <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>True Witness</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> within, that he whom God hath ordained to <hi>Reign,</hi> may be great in them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Lastly,</hi> my <hi>Dear Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> by how much this <hi>Day</hi> draws Nigh, by so much the more do ye <hi>Stand loose</hi> in your <hi>Affections</hi> to the World, but <hi>fast</hi> in the <hi>Faith.</hi> And <hi>Assemble</hi> your selves together, and let God <hi>Arise</hi> in you, and his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> among you, that ye may not only Wrestle, but in the End <hi>Prevail;</hi> That it may be seen, that SALVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION <hi>is of the Jews,</hi> the <hi>Jews Inward,</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi> and in <hi>Truth:</hi> And truly, the time hastens, that <hi>Ten</hi> shall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60236:3"/>take hold of the <hi>Skirt</hi> of such a <hi>Jew,</hi> and they shall be <hi>saved.</hi> But <hi>We</hi> to the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in that Day, the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malist,</hi> the <hi>Jew Outward,</hi> the <hi>Circumcision in the Flesh</hi> and Fleshly <hi>Christian,</hi> that cannot resist the <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of this World, the <hi>Temporizer,</hi> one that <hi>Runs with the Tide,</hi> he will be <hi>Divided.</hi> For there will be more <hi>Tides,</hi> more <hi>Interests</hi> on Foot at once, than One; wherefore <hi>Perplexity</hi> will take hold on him, his <hi>Policy</hi> will be <hi>Confounded.</hi> He will not know what to do to be <hi>Safe,</hi> nor what to <hi>Joyn</hi> with; this <hi>Double minded Man</hi> will be <hi>Unstable</hi> in his Counsels and in his Actions, his <hi>Sandy Foundation</hi> will be <hi>shaken.</hi> Therefore, as I said, <hi>We</hi> to the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and to the <hi>Covetous Man</hi> too, for his Gods will fail him; the <hi>Thief,</hi> the <hi>Moth</hi> and <hi>Rust</hi> will invade his Baggs and surprize his Treasure: his <hi>Anguish</hi> will be <hi>Great</hi> in this Day! But my <hi>Dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> as the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Lord God will Preserve and Establish us, if we <hi>Sincerely</hi> and <hi>Entirely</hi> conside therein, and that above our Sollicitation or Need of <hi>Carnal Consultations</hi> or <hi>Contrivances,</hi> which we have therefore laid aside; so shall it Vindicate us in <hi>Due Time</hi> in the Eyes of all <hi>Nations,</hi> and present us a People owned, beloved and protected of God, in whom we have firmly believed. Nor is this <hi>Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as some <hi>may think,</hi> who being not so well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that <hi>Entire Resignation</hi> and Supreme <hi>Faith</hi> (of which <hi>Jesus</hi> is the Author, that removes <hi>Mountains</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sea</hi>) conclude from meer <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Human Considerations</hi> against us; yet we know him in whom we have believed: and the same, that hath <hi>Cured</hi> us of our <hi>Diseases,</hi> the same said unto us, <hi>Arise and Walk in this Way of Faith; Trust in me,</hi> and not in another. And truly, this is much of that <hi>Wonder,</hi> which Men
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60236:4"/>shall have in their Minds and Mouthes about us in those <hi>Latter Dayes, In Troubles not to be dejected, and in Jeopardies not to be concerned</hi> to make to our selves <hi>Defences;</hi> but as the <hi>Lillies,</hi> that neither toil not spin, yet seed and grow, so we may both be preserved and become <hi>Victorious</hi> without <hi>Worldly Force</hi> or <hi>Projections.</hi> For we must shew our selves to be that <hi>Little City</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> of God, that hath only his <hi>Salvation</hi> for our <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Bulwarks;</hi> by whom he will renown his Arm, and magnifie his Power above the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of Men. Our <hi>Weapons</hi> and our <hi>Armour</hi> is <hi>Spiritual;</hi> it hath prevailed, and it will prevail, if we keep in the <hi>Faith,</hi> which was <hi>first delivered</hi> to us: a blessed <hi>Shield,</hi> by which the <hi>Just live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>My Dear Friends,</hi> let us be Careful not to <hi>mingle with the Crowd,</hi> lest their <hi>Spirit</hi> enter us instead of our <hi>Spirit</hi> entring them, and we thereby come to fall into the same <hi>Temptations</hi> they are liable to, of <hi>Pear</hi> and <hi>Flying to the Hills and Mountains</hi> to protect them, considing in the <hi>Arm</hi> of <hi>Flesh</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; no, no! they must come to us, we must not go to them. Yet can we not be Unsensible of their <hi>Infirmities,</hi> as well as we shall not be free from some of their <hi>Sufferings;</hi> we must make their <hi>Case</hi> as our own, and travail alike in Spirit for them, as for our selves. Let us stand in the <hi>Counsel</hi> of our God, and he will make us <hi>Preachers</hi> forth to them of the Works of his <hi>Divine Power,</hi> and the <hi>Virtue</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> which comes from Heaven; yea, he will make us as <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> to the People, that they may come to know the Holy <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> (their Creator) in their Hearts, and have their <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> turned to him, and stay'd upon him, that <hi>Iniquity</hi> may no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60236:4"/>more abound, nor <hi>Ungodliness</hi> find a place: but that in <hi>Truth, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> they may be establisht, and the Land keep its <hi>SABBATH</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi> for ever!
